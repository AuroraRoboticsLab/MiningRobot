Sensor is physically bigger than the D435.

Includes an accelerometer by default.  Plugging it into an Ubuntu 20.04 box causes the screen to rotate (!) matching the camera orientation unless you hit start menu -> Lock screen rotation.

Screen rotation happens because iio-sensor-proxy feeds the orientation into dbus.  See the readings with:
    monitor-sensor
Eliminate this with:
    sudo apt-get purge iio-sensor-proxy

Needs a recent RealSense 2 library install:
    https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases
The .tar.gz just works on Ubuntu 20.04, but takes about an hour to compile.
    sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libgtk-3-dev libglfw3-dev libzmq3-dev cmake libssl-dev
    tar xzvf librealsense*.tar.gz
    cd librealsense*
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

Install the udev support in /dev/udev.d/rules.d/ with 
    librealsense-2.44.0/scripts/setup_udev_rules.sh
