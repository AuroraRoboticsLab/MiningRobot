Write a .service file in /etc/systemd/system/ to describe one service:


[Unit]
Description=Example systemd service.

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash /usr/bin/test_service.sh
Restart=always
RestartSec=2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target



Reload config files
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Manually start, stop, or restart:
  sudo systemctl start myservice
  sudo systemctl stop myservice
  sudo systemctl restart myservice

Check status and see stdout:
  sudo systemctl status myservice

Run at boot forever: 
  sudo systemctl enable myservice

You can add several "After=" or "Requires=" dependencies to a Unit to make its startup depend on other services.

Requires: startup will fail if it doesn't come up

E.g., robot service 
Requires=backend
Wants=realsense
