Basic idea: instead of one big monolithic Arduino, we have dedicated motor controller micros, in their own 3D-printed cases.  E.g., one left side, one right side, one for mining head.


+ Use simpler, more reliable parts (spare electronics possible)
+ Less wire crossing the robot
- More parts to build


UN178 motor controller x2, each doing 2 motors (4 total motors)

	2x PWM inputs, one each for A and B motors
	4x digital inputs for A and B sides
	gnd in

3-pin encoder inputs (x4? x6?).  Servo 3-pin cables: gnd, 5v, encoder
	1 per controlled motor
	Plus 2 spares: redundant encoders, bag up/down, etc.

RJ-45 serial uplink to main controller: 5v (orange), ground (orange-white), tx0 (brown), rx0 (green)

Nano PWM-capable pins: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11


RA motor: dir 2,4  PWM 3
RB motor: dir 5,7  PWM 6

LA motor: dir 12,A0  PWM 11
LB motor: dir 9,8   PWM 10
